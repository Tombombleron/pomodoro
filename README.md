# pomodoro

This is my attempt at the final task in the Odin Project's ['Web Development 101'](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) curriculum to develop a [pomodoro timer](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (I have also included jQuery within my project).
